    Synopsis: He took distance from his old life, his family, his friends, escaping to the tropics.
    The days slipped by to the rhythm of the sun and the waves, between bars, beaches,where time seemed to stop. 
    He let himself go and indulged in simple pleasures and lively nights, savoring each instant like it would last forever. 
    But the distance had been enough, and he now felt it was time to return to where he came from, to face his matters and take control once again.

  <h1 class=Music-head >FULL M00N — The Prologue</h1>  
  <p class="description">
          You’ve been here before.<br>
          It always starts the same way.<br><br>

          You begin with nothing — weightless, almost invisible, just trying to exist.<br>
          Then, you rise. You climb. You feel the warmth of being up, the rush of becoming something more.<br>
          You taste life at its peak — alive, unstoppable, untouchable.<br>
          And then… it slips. Slowly, then all at once.<br>
          The high fades. The lights dim. You fall down.<br><br>

          You try to hold on, but the noise inside grows silent.<br>
          Something dies — maybe the dream, maybe the part of you that believed.<br>

          <br>And there you are again… nothing.<br>
          The circle closes, only to start again.<br><br>

          You lived this cycle so many times that it became you — comforting, toxic, addictive.<br>
          Until the night you realized the moon was full, and it was time to break free.<br>
    </p>

        <!-- You used to think life moved forward.
But yours just keeps spinning — like a record stuck on the same song. Nothing. Up. Alive. Down. Die. Again and again, until you can’t tell where it starts or where it ends.

You came from nothing. Empty hands, empty head, empty heart. Then you climbed — slow, hungry, wild. You thought you were becoming someone. You thought you were rising.

Up.
The air is thin up there. It feels good though — dangerous, dizzying. You start believing you could stay forever. The nights blur into light. The music is too loud to think. The world spins and you don’t care.

Alive.
That’s the lie you tell yourself. That this high is living. But everything that burns bright burns fast, and when the fire goes out, there’s only smoke.

Then comes the fall. Down. Hard and quiet. You start losing pieces of yourself on the way — little things first, then bigger ones. The smiles, the people, the will. Until one day, you wake up and realize you’re already gone.

Die.
It’s not death you feel. It’s absence. Like your reflection decided to leave without you.

You thought the cycle was who you were. But it’s been killing you all along.

And somewhere between the silence and the moonlight, you finally understand —
if you ever want to be free, something in you has to end for real. -->
